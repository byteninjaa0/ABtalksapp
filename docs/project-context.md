# ABTalks — Project Context Document

> **Purpose of this file:** Single-source-of-truth context to start fresh chats. Paste this at the beginning of any new conversation so the AI has full project context.

> **Last updated:** 2026-08-24, reconciled against commit `3b040d8` (master — "Merge branch 'feature/student-dashboard' into master"). The student-dashboard hub itself landed one merge earlier, at `d404d04` (PR #199); `3b040d8` is the verified current `master` HEAD. Covers everything logged under `## Pending reconcile` in `docs/CHANGELOG.md` through 2026-08-24.

> **The recruiter sections describe `/hire`, which lands with this change.**
> Scout, the recruiter desk and the engagement flow supersede the `/talent`
> pool browser, which is removed. The feature ships behind no flag of its own,
> but the pool it can reach is bounded by `HIRE_OPEN_COHORT_IDS` and
> `HIRE_CHALLENGE_POOL`, both unset by default. Everything else in this
> document describes `3b040d8`.

> **Read this before changing anything data-related.** The platform is **mid-migration**. Plan 078 added a new data model **alongside** the existing one. Three states must be kept apart:
>
> - **A. LEGACY DATA MODEL** — still live, still populated, and **authoritative for every read** in production.
> - **B. NEW 078 DATA MODEL** — the additive tables already exist in production and are receiving **dual-writes** on supported paths (`ENABLE_DUAL_WRITE` is on).
> - **C. TARGET STATE** — the new model becomes authoritative only after backfill, verification, **Phase 6** read switching, **Phase 7** write cutover, and eventually **Phase 8** cleanup. None of those have started.
>
> Nothing legacy has been retired or dropped. See §4 (078 subsection) for the model and §18 for phase status.

## 1. What is ABTalks

Originally a 60-day coding challenge platform built around Anil Bajpai's community of recruiters and students. It is now one **Learning + Evidence + Talent platform**: candidates learn on the platform, their activity generates *evidence*, that evidence rolls up into a single candidate profile, and recruiters discover and evaluate candidates from that demonstrated evidence rather than from a self-written résumé.

### The core candidate journey

```
User
  → Candidate profile
      → Courses / Cohorts / Challenges / Hackathons / Assessments / Interviews
          → activities and submissions generate evidence
              → evidence contributes to the unified candidate profile
                  → recruiters search candidates on demonstrated evidence
                      → recruiter shortlists / evaluates / hires
```

A candidate is expected to participate in **several learning programs at once** (e.g. the SE challenge, the Claude track, and the AI Cohort). Multi-enrollment is a first-class requirement, not an edge case — see §5 and the 078 learning spine in §4.

### The learning surfaces that feed it

These are the products that exist today. They share one auth + admin spine, and under 078 they become implementations of the same learning spine rather than four separate systems:

1. **60-Day Challenge** — daily tasks across SE / DS / AI / CLAUDE, GitHub + LinkedIn proof of work, streaks, leaderboard, certificates.
2. **AI Cohort Program** (`/program`, formerly "B2B AI Mastery") — a 31-day cohort for working professionals with server-verified Daily Missions, GitHub commit tracking, AI-graded projects, an exit voice interview, and a recruiter talent portal (`/talent`).
3. **Hackathon** (`/hackathon`) — solo/team registration with share-link attribution, a participant dashboard, submissions and certificates.
4. **Workshops & AI Cohort applications** (`/ai-workshop`, `/ai-cohort-register`, `/ai-cohort-india`) — top-of-funnel webinar signups and long-form applications.

### What the candidate profile is meant to contain

The unified profile is the durable asset. Its intended contents (the 078 schema already models all of these — see §4):

education · professional experience · projects · skills · external certifications · LinkedIn · GitHub · résumé · achievements · platform-issued credentials · assessments · interview results · hackathon achievements · evidence-derived skill strength.

**Planned additive extensions (do NOT assume these models exist yet):**

- external coding profiles — LeetCode, CodeChef, Codeforces, Kaggle and similar
- opportunity-type preferences — internship / full-time / freelance / contract / part-time

Both are expected to land as **additive** schema later. Neither blocked the 078 migration, and neither has been built. `CandidatePreference` today covers `openToWork`, `availableFrom`, preferred roles/locations and remote preference only.

**Vision:** Public, verifiable proof of work produces real skill and real visibility — and that proof, not a claim, is what recruiters search.

**Audience:** Indian college students (1st year through recent graduates), primarily mobile — plus working professionals for the Program track.

## 2. Hard constraints

- Solo developer, building with Cursor + Claude (Claude plans, Cursor executes)
- Free or near-free hosting (Vercel free tier, Neon free tier)
- IST (Asia/Kolkata) for all day boundaries. The Program track previously ran on America/Chicago; `PROGRAM_TZ` in `features/program/constants.ts` is now **`Asia/Kolkata`** (changed 2026-08-12). Keep using `PROGRAM_TZ` rather than hard-coding — cohort `startsAt`/`endsAt` round-trip through `fromZonedTime(PROGRAM_TZ)`.
- **Scale (observed in production during the 078 migration, 2026-08):** ~12,803 `User` rows, ~3,183 legacy challenge `Enrollment` rows, ~15k historical submissions/attempt-scale rows, ~15k `SynergyEvent`/points-scale rows. The old "~1,500 students" ceiling in this document was obsolete and has been removed; no new hard maximum is being asserted — size work against these observed volumes.
- **One Neon project, several branches** — no longer "one database for dev and prod":
  - `production` branch (`br-soft-bread-amu5tms1`) — the live database
  - `plan-078-phase1` — sample-only 078 migration test bed (never full-backfilled)
  - `plan-078-rehearsal` — full unscoped Phase 1–5 rehearsal child, created from latest production
  - `plan-078-prod-snapshot-20260824` (`br-silent-art-amv1yn8s`) — snapshot taken before the Phase 1 production rollout
  - project id `little-fog-11679677`
- **All Neon mutations must target a production child branch** unless that exact production write is explicitly authorized.

---

## 3. Tech stack (as deployed)

- **Framework:** Next.js 16.2.4 (App Router, TypeScript strict, Turbopack), React 19.2.4
- **Database:** PostgreSQL on Neon. `DATABASE_URL` (pooled, `-pooler.` host) is the application connection. `DIRECT_URL` (non-pooler host) is required for anything needing real session semantics — see the connection rules below.
- **ORM:** Prisma 6.19.3 (NOT Prisma 7 — pinned)
- **Auth:** Auth.js v5 (next-auth@beta) with split config (`auth.config.ts` edge-safe, `auth.ts` full Node)
- **Auth providers:** Google OAuth (production), Credentials (dev-only, gated by `ENABLE_DEV_AUTH=true`, plain string compare, no bcrypt)
- **Deployment:** Vercel (`abtalksapp.vercel.app`), plus a Vercel cron for program commit polling
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui on Base UI (`@base-ui/react`), slate base
- **Fonts:** Plus Jakarta Sans (display), Inter (body); `@fontsource/dseg7-classic` for countdown displays
- **Forms:** React Hook Form + Zod 4
- **Motion:** framer-motion; `canvas-confetti` for celebrations
- **Charts:** Recharts (admin analytics)
- **Toasts:** sonner
- **Markdown:** react-markdown (program day briefs, mission content)
- **AI:** Anthropic via `lib/anthropic.ts` (project grading, AI mentor, recommendations, interview evaluation); OpenAI Realtime (WebRTC voice interview only)
- **Email:** Resend (`RESEND_API_KEY`) and Brevo (`@getbrevo/brevo`) — see `lib/email.ts`, `lib/workshop-email.ts`, `lib/hackathon-email.ts`
- **SMS/OTP:** MSG91 widget (`lib/msg91.ts`) for phone verification
- **PDF:** `pdf-lib` + `qrcode` for certificates (template overlay); `@react-pdf/renderer` for the recruiter report at `/r/[token]/pdf` (Node runtime only)
- **Supabase (residual):** `@supabase/supabase-js` still used for exactly two things — the hand-edited `workshop_config` row and the `cohort_applications` / `cohort_applications_india` tables. Everything else moved to Neon.
- **Validation:** Zod everywhere
- **Logging:** Custom `lib/logger.ts` (console wrappers, edge-safe)

**Critical:** Middleware must remain edge-safe — NO `@/lib/*` imports in `middleware.ts`. Uses only `next-auth` and `next/server`.

### Database connection rules (pooled vs direct)

| Operation | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| Ordinary app reads / writes | Pooled `DATABASE_URL` (`-pooler.` host is fine) |
| Prisma migrations | `DIRECT_URL` (non-pooler) |
| Migration scripts / Phase 2 backfill / drift checks | Direct host — **never** `-pooler` |
| 078 dual-write interactive transactions | `DIRECT_URL`. `writeClient()` in `lib/db.ts` returns the direct client whenever dual-write is on, stripping `-pooler.` from `DATABASE_URL` as a fallback |

**Observed failure (do not re-litigate):** Neon's transaction-mode pooler drops Prisma **interactive transactions that use `SAVEPOINT`**. The 078 dual-write wraps every new-side write in a savepoint so a new-table failure cannot fail the legacy request — through the pooled endpoint that behavior failed; through the direct Neon endpoint it succeeded. Any interactive-transaction / migration work that depends on savepoints must use the **non-pooler** host. `PRODUCTION_NEON_HOST_ID` guards scripts against pointing at the wrong host.

---

## 4. Domain model (Prisma schema)

> **Two data models coexist right now.** Everything from *Auth tables* through *Program tables* below is the **LEGACY model (A)**: still live, still populated, still **authoritative for every production read**, and still what you debug against. The final subsection — *078 platform architecture* — is the **NEW additive model (B)**: those tables exist in production and receive dual-writes on supported paths, but no UI reads them. Nothing legacy has been retired, renamed or dropped.

### Auth tables (Auth.js standard)
- `User` — `email`, `password` (dev only, plaintext), `role` (STUDENT | ADMIN | RECRUITER), **`synergyPoints`** (the single user-level SP wallet since 2026-08-18), `deletedAt` / `anonymizedAt` (soft delete + PII scrub, added by 078 Phase 1)
- `Account`, `Session`, `VerificationToken`

### Core enums
- `Role`: STUDENT, ADMIN, **RECRUITER**
- `UserType`: STUDENT, PROFESSIONAL — a `StudentProfile` row can represent either. Distinct from `Role`.
- `Domain`: SE, DS, AI, CLAUDE (Claude AI Mastery track — synchronized cohort, see `Challenge.startsAt`). Was ML originally, renamed to DS.
- `EnrollmentStatus`: ACTIVE, COMPLETED, ABANDONED
- `SubmissionStatus`: ON_TIME, LATE

### Challenge tables
- `StudentProfile` (1:1 with User) — `userType`, `fullName`, **`domain` (nullable — null until the user joins their first track; registration is profile-only)**, `collegeId` (nullable, plain column with no FK; `college` stays the display string), `skills[]`, `phone` + `phoneVerified` / `phoneVerifiedAt` (admin-only visibility), `resumeUrl`, `linkedinUrl`, `githubUsername`, `referralCode` (unique), `isReadyForInterview`, **`synergyPoints`** (denormalized SP balance). Student-only: `college`, `graduationYear`. Professional-only: `organization`, `role`, `yearsExperience`. Campus-ambassador: `isCampusAmbassadorCandidate`, `ambassadorAppliedAt`, `ambassadorDismissedAt`.
- `Challenge` — one per Domain, `totalDays = 60`. Optional `startsAt: DateTime?` — when set (CLAUDE), the reference start is `max(startsAt, enrollment.startedAt)`; null = rolling start (SE/DS/AI).
- `DailyTask` — 1–60 per Challenge: `problemStatement`, `learningObjectives`, `resources`, `difficulty`, `estimatedMinutes`, `linkedinTemplate` (`{{github_link}}` placeholder), `solutionApproach` (admin-only), `tags`, `dayContent` (Json?) for rich CLAUDE day pages.
- `Enrollment` (unique userId+challengeId) — daysCompleted, currentStreak, longestStreak, lastSubmittedDay, status, startedAt, completedAt; 0–1 `Certificate`.
- `Submission` (unique enrollmentId+dayNumber) — `githubUrl` and `linkedinUrl` are both **nullable** (proof URLs became optional when Synergy landed); `githubUrl` still globally unique when present. Has 0–1 `SynergyEvent`.
- `Quiz` (unique challengeId+weekNumber), `QuizQuestion` (10 per quiz), `QuizAttempt` (unique userId+quizId)
- `Referral` (unique referredId) — referrerId, referredId, rewardGiven
- `PhoneVerification` (unique userId) — E.164 phone, verified flag; bridges OTP done before `StudentProfile` exists

### Synergy / rewards (LEGACY — still authoritative)
- **One wallet:** `User.synergyPoints` is the SP balance for challenge *and* hackathon students (since 2026-08-18). `StudentProfile.synergyPoints` is kept as a temporary rollback mirror.
- `SynergyEvent` — append-only SP ledger: userId, points (+/-), type, optional submissionId (unique) / enrollmentId / dayNumber / rankAtAward / reason / createdByAdminId. **Every SP movement gets a row** — redemptions and refunds included. Includes `BALANCE_RECONCILIATION` rows written when an admin reset/reject would otherwise push a balance negative.
- The new 078 equivalents (`PointsAccount` / `PointsTransaction`) are written **in addition** while dual-write is on. They are not authoritative — see §4's 078 subsection.
- `MarketplaceItem` — slug, title, description, `costSP`, imagePath, active, sortOrder
- `Redemption` — userId, itemId, costSP + itemTitle snapshots, `status` (PENDING | SHIPPED | FULFILLED | …), shippingAddress, recipientPhone, trackingNote

### Certificates
- `Certificate` — `certificateId` (public, `ABT-XX-XXXXX`, Crockford alphabet, unique), userId, `type` (CLAUDE_CHALLENGE | HACKATHON | COHORT | WORKSHOP), `status` (ISSUED | REVOKED), `recipientName` + `domain` + `metadata` **snapshots at issue time** (never re-read from the profile), `enrollmentId` (unique, one cert per completed enrollment), revokedAt / revokedReason. Hackathon placement certs (winner / 2nd / 3rd / top5) are extra `HACKATHON` rows distinguished by `metadata.hackathonVariant`, sharing the same overlay layout.

### Recruiter-facing (challenge side)
- `RecruiterReview` (unique userId) — admin-curated anonymized assessment report: `/100` scores (communication / programming / behavior) + feedback, resume sections (`skillGroups`, `education`, `certifications`, `experience`, `projects`, `achievements[]`, `languagesSpoken[]`), `codingChallenges`, strengths / areasForGrowth, `recommendation` (`RecommendationLevel`), admin-only `logistics` + `compensation`, `isPublished` + `shareToken` (unique) for the public `/r/[token]` page.
- `Job` (`JobType`: FULL_TIME | INTERNSHIP | CONTRACT | PART_TIME) and `JobApplication` (unique jobId+userId)

### Hire / recruiter desk tables
- `TalentRequest` — one recruiter brief. Holds the spec Scout assembled (role, stack, experience, budget, location) plus the transcript, so a guest conversation can be adopted onto a row at sign-in rather than lost. `alertWhenAvailable` is set by the demand button when a search returns nothing.
- `TalentEngagementRequest` — **one row per recruiter/candidate pair**, deliberately not one per batch: the team decides each introduction separately and contact release is per pair. `status` (`TalentEngagementStatus`: DRAFT → SUBMITTED → IN_REVIEW → CONTACT_SHARED / DECLINED / CLOSED) is what releases identity — access is *derived* from this status and never stored as a second flag a bug could leave switched on. `source` (`TalentCandidateSource`: PROGRAM | CHALLENGE_60 | CLAUDE | HACKATHON) records which track the candidate came from. `candidatePublicId` denormalises the AB-#### the recruiter saw, so admin and recruiter are demonstrably discussing the same person.
- `TalentEngagementMessage` — the thread on one engagement; `authorRole` is `recruiter` | `admin`.
- `CandidateAvailability` — candidate-side availability, kept apart from `searchableByRecruiters`.
- `VerifiedRecruiterSeat` — allow-list of verified recruiter seats.
- `RecruiterEmailOtp` — email OTP baseline for recruiter sign-in (recruiters have their own door at `/talent/login`, not the candidate Google button).

### Reference data
- `College` — canonical institution catalog (54,651 institutions), queried with a pg_trgm index. `StudentProfile.collegeId` stores the picked id; `StudentProfile.college` remains the display string so no read path has to join.

### Notifications
- `Notification` + `NotificationRead` — admin-composed notices (`/admin/notifications`). Read state is keyed by an **opaque string, deliberately not an FK**. Automated workshop / hackathon / cohort notices are **derived at read time** from `EVENTS`, hackathon config and `ENROLLING` `ProgramCohort` rows — no rows, no cron, and the read path stays write-free. The bell shows only the newest 5 items (`FEED_LIMIT`), so there is deliberately no dismiss control and no dismissed state.

### Legal / consent tables
- `LegalConsent` — every terms/privacy acceptance, including `source: "oauth_signup"` rows written by `auth.ts` `events.createUser`
- `DataRightsRequest` — DPDP DSAR intake, surfaced at `/admin/data-requests`
- `NewsletterSubscription` — newsletter opt-in captured on all signup funnels

### Admin tables
- `AdminAction` — adminUserId, targetUserId, `actionType` (string), metadata (Json), reason, createdAt. Written by every admin mutation across all tracks, not just the 5 original student actions.
- `AdminRemark` — admin-only free-text remark history on a student (CRUD writes an `AdminAction` audit row)

### Hackathon tables (all on Neon — the Supabase `hackathon_*` tables are retired)
- `HackathonTeam` — `entryType` (SOLO | TEAM), teamName, `teamCode` (unique). Unique index on `lower(team_name)` where not null.
- `HackathonParticipant` — `userId` **globally unique** (one hackathon registration per person), teamId + `slotIndex` (unique together), isLeader, contact/college fields, `sourceSlug` (share-link attribution)
- `HackathonRemoval` — append-only removal log. The participant row is **hard-deleted** on removal (frees `userId` and the slot); this table preserves who/by whom/original `sourceSlug` so a rejoin keeps attribution. `removedByRole`: LEADER | ADMIN.
- `HackathonEvent` — singleton (id = 1), `problemStatement` for the live kickoff brief
- `HackathonProblem`, `HackathonSubmission` — the submission flow at `/hackathon/submission`. `HackathonSubmission.teamId` is unique: **one submission per team**, which is exactly why hackathons stay a separate bounded subsystem under 078 (see below).
- `HackathonLink` — named share links (`?s=<slug>`), inserted by hand / seeded

### Workshop table
- `WorkshopRegistration` — every workshop/webinar signup, **all events in one table** keyed by `eventId` (matches `WorkshopEvent.id` in `components/workshop/events-data.ts`; events stay code-defined because they carry marketing copy + Lucide icons). `userId` is **REQUIRED** — Google sign-in is mandatory, so every row belongs to a real User. Only constraint is `@@unique([eventId, userId])`: the same person is expected to register for each weekly workshop, but not twice for the same one. Row snapshots name/email/phone/role/organization/graduationYear because a workshop-only attendee has a `User` but no `StudentProfile`.

### Program tables (`/program` track, ~20 models)
Enums: `ProgramCohortStatus` (DRAFT | ENROLLING | ACTIVE | COMPLETED | ARCHIVED), `ProgramMemberStatus` (APPLIED | WAITLISTED | ENROLLED | COMPLETED | DROPPED), `ProgramLanguage` (PYTHON | SQL | JAVASCRIPT | YAML), `ProgramEntrySection`, `ProgramInterviewStatus`, `ProgramProjectStatus`, `ProgramMissionType` (CODE_SPRINT | SHIP_IT | DATA_ROOM | PROMPT_FORGE | BOSS_BUILD), `ProgramDayState` (LOCKED | AVAILABLE | PASSED | SKIPPED).

- `ProgramCohort` — name, `joinCode` (unique), startsAt / endsAt, capacity (100), status, `requiresJoinCode` (default true; false = open enrollment), `resultsPublishedAt`
- `ProgramMember` — professional profile kept **deliberately separate from `StudentProfile`** (fullName, education, university, …), status, scores, skip tokens, highest unlocked day. **`jobRole`, `company` and `yearsExperience` are nullable** (registration became profile-only on 2026-08-20). Also carries `recruiterVisibilityConsentAt` — a legacy talent gate, **not** a user toggle; new applications stamp it automatically.
- `ProgramModule`, `ProgramDay`, `ProgramConceptQuestion`, `ProgramMissionSubmission`, `ProgramConceptAttempt`
- `ProgramEntryQuestion`, `ProgramEntryAttempt` (entry assessment — retained in schema, bypassed in product)
- `ProgramVideo`, `ProgramExercise`, `ProgramExerciseCompletion`
- `ProgramCommitDay` — one row per member per qualifying GitHub commit day
- `ProgramProject` (AI-graded module projects), `ProgramInterview` (exit voice interview + Claude evaluation)
- `RecruiterProfile`, `RecruiterShortlistItem` — the `/talent` portal

### 078 platform architecture — additive production schema, migration in progress

Source plans: `docs/plans/078-platform-data-architecture-redesign.md` (the design),
`078-production-conservative-rollout.md` (the production gate checklist),
`078-sample-validation-and-rollout.md` (the rehearsal runbook).

**State as of 2026-08-24:** additive schema **applied to production**; dual-write
**live**; historical backfill **in progress and incomplete**; **no read switched
over**. Every `ENABLE_NEW_*` flag is off. Legacy remains authoritative. See §18
for the phase-by-phase status.

**What is in production:** 47 new tables from
`20260820120000_platform_data_architecture_phase1`, plus 3 audit tables from
`20260820130000_phase2_migration_audit` (`MigrationRun`, `MigrationConflict`,
`MigrationQuarantine`). Both migrations are recorded as applied. Phase 1 also
added `User.deletedAt` / `User.anonymizedAt`, made `Certificate` / `SynergyEvent` /
`RecruiterShortlistItem` FKs `ON DELETE RESTRICT` (so a hard user delete can no
longer destroy recruiting evidence), and made actor FKs `SET NULL`. No
`DROP TABLE`, `DROP COLUMN` or `RENAME` was part of it.

A later additive migration `20260824153000_candidate_visibility_searchable_default`
changed **only the column default**: `CandidateVisibility.searchableByRecruiters`
`DEFAULT false` → `DEFAULT true`. It did **not** bulk-update existing rows.

#### Three bounded contexts + one shared identity

**IDENTITY / CANDIDATE** — `User`, `UserRoleAssignment`, `CandidateProfile`,
`CandidateVisibility`, `CandidateEducation`, `CandidateExperience`,
`CandidateProjectEntry`, `CandidateCertification`, `CandidatePreference`,
`SkillCategory`, `Skill`, `CandidateSkill`

**LEARNING** — `ProgramCategory`, `LearningProgram`, `ProgramVersion`, `Cohort`,
`Module`, `Activity`, `ActivityPrerequisite`, the typed activity configs
(`CodingActivityConfig` + `TestCase`, `QuizActivityConfig` + `Question` +
`QuestionOption`, `ProjectActivityConfig`, `ContentActivityConfig`,
`ExternalSubmissionConfig`), `ActivitySkill`, `ProgramSkill`, `ProgramEnrollment`,
`EnrollmentProgress`, `ActivityAttempt`, `ActivityEvaluation`,
`EnrollmentDayActivity`

**RECRUITING** — `Organization`, `OrganizationMember`, `RecruiterProfile`,
`TalentList`, `TalentListItem`, `CandidateNote`, `Job`, `JobApplication`,
`JobSkill`, `AssessmentReport`, `AssessmentScore`, `AssessmentReportShare`
(`Job` / `JobApplication` / `RecruiterProfile` are pre-existing tables the
recruiting context adopts; `JobSkill` and the rest are new)

**CROSS-CUTTING** (written by many, read by the profile) — `Credential`,
`CandidateAchievement`, `PointsAccount`, `PointsTransaction`, `SkillEvidence`

> **The invariant that makes this work: learning WRITES evidence, recruiting READS
> evidence.** The two contexts share `User.id` and nothing else. Recruiting must
> never depend on learning subsystem internals, and learning must never read
> recruiting tables.

#### Program → Version → Cohort

| Model | What it is |
|---|---|
| `LearningProgram` | the reusable program definition — e.g. "31 Days of Databricks" |
| `ProgramVersion` | an immutable, published content snapshot — Version 1 |
| `Cohort` | one scheduled run of one `ProgramVersion` — the Aug 2026 cohort |

```
"31 Days of Databricks"  →  Version 1  →  Aug 2026 cohort
                         →  Version 2  →  Sep/Oct cohort
```

Editing content for a future run means publishing a **new version**, never
mutating the old one. That is what prevents a future content edit from changing
historical submissions and results.

`Cohort.startMode` (`ROLLING | FIXED`) plus an optional `startsAt` floor plus
`Cohort.timezone` reproduce all of today's day-math in one expression: rolling
(SE/DS/AI), hybrid (CLAUDE — `max(challenge.startsAt, enrollment.startedAt)`)
and fixed-date (the Program cohort).

#### Unified Activity / Attempt / Evaluation

`ActivityType` currently supports: `CODING`, `QUIZ`, `PROJECT`, `ASSIGNMENT`,
`CONTENT`, `VIDEO`, `INTERVIEW`, `EXTERNAL_SUBMISSION`, `DAILY_CHALLENGE`.

- **`ActivityAttempt`** — what the candidate submitted or did (payload, attempt
  number, timestamps, lateness). Candidate/enrollment-owned: every attempt belongs
  to exactly one enrolled user.
- **`ActivityEvaluation`** — what was *decided* about that attempt.
  `EvaluatorType`: `AUTO | AI | HUMAN | EXTERNAL | SELF`. Multiple evaluations per
  attempt, so re-grading and admin override keep full history instead of
  destructively overwriting a score.

**This is the target representation, not the serving one.** No live UI reads
`Activity` / `ActivityAttempt` / `ActivityEvaluation`. The challenge still reads
`Submission`; the program still reads `ProgramMissionSubmission`.

#### Hackathon: deliberately a separate bounded subsystem

078 decision (§3.4 of the plan): **do not** force hackathon submissions into
`ActivityAttempt`. `ActivityAttempt` is candidate/enrollment-owned; a hackathon
submission is **team**-owned (`HackathonSubmission.teamId` is unique), with slot
mechanics and audited removals. Modelling that as an attempt would require
group-owned attempts, breaking the invariant that keeps the learning side safe to
reason about.

Hackathon outcomes reach the unified profile through **three explicit bridges**,
written by the hackathon subsystem and read by the recruiting side:

| Bridge | Written when | What the recruiter sees |
|---|---|---|
| `CandidateAchievement` | results published / submission accepted | "ViCoDathon 2026 — 2nd place, team Nova" |
| `Credential` (`sourceType: HACKATHON_TEAM`) | certificate issued | a verifiable credential in the candidate's list |
| `SkillEvidence` (`sourceType: HACKATHON`) | results published, per `HackathonProblem.skills` | contributes to `CandidateSkill.evidenceScore` |

`CandidateAchievement` is the **generic** bridge — any future subsystem writes one
row and appears on the unified profile without recruiting learning anything about
that subsystem's internals.

**Target vs today:** the target architecture supports **multiple hackathons per
person** (participation is per event). The live schema still has
`HackathonParticipant.userId` **globally unique** — one hackathon registration per
person, forever. That constraint has **not** been changed and is not part of this
rollout.

#### Credentials, certifications and evidence — three different things

| Model | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `CandidateCertification` | an **external** certification the candidate claims (AWS, Coursera, …) |
| `Credential` | a **platform-issued**, verifiable credential. Append-only; `@@unique([type, sourceType, sourceKey])` makes double-issue structurally impossible |
| `SkillEvidence` | evidence rows emitted by learning, hackathons, assessments and future subsystems |
| `CandidateSkill.evidenceScore` / `.verified` | **derived / cached** from `SkillEvidence`, recomputed on evidence insert |
| `CandidateAchievement` | the generic bridge for accomplishments from any subsystem into the unified profile |

#### Points — both representations coexist

- **Legacy (authoritative today):** `User.synergyPoints` balance + append-only
  `SynergyEvent` ledger. Live UI and business logic still read and write these.
- **New (target):** `PointsTransaction` is the append-only source of truth, with
  `idempotencyKey @unique` making duplicate awards structurally impossible.
  `PointsAccount.balance` is a cached balance written in the same transaction,
  with a `version` optimistic lock and a nightly reconcile.

While dual-write is on, a points movement writes **both**. The legacy balance has
**not** been retired.

#### Interviews — target mapping only

```
Activity(type = INTERVIEW) → ActivityAttempt → ActivityEvaluation
                           → AssessmentReport → AssessmentScore
```

`ProgramInterview` (the exit voice interview) is still the **legacy, live** model
and has **not** been migrated. Future interview-agent work should go through the
repository layer (§9) and the new models rather than binding tightly to
`ProgramInterview`.

#### Source of truth vs cache (new model)

| Fact | Source of truth | Cache |
|---|---|---|
| Points balance | `PointsTransaction` (SUM) | `PointsAccount.balance` |
| Activity completion | `ActivityEvaluation.passed` | `ActivityAttempt.passed`, `EnrollmentProgress.completedActivities` |
| Progress % / score / streak | attempts + evaluations | `EnrollmentProgress.*` (same-transaction write + nightly recompute) |
| Skill strength | `SkillEvidence` | `CandidateSkill.evidenceScore` / `.verified` |
| Credential contents | — | **N/A — deliberate immutable snapshot** |

`EnrollmentProgress` is never the input to an authorization or unlock decision;
those recompute from attempts.

#### Learning catalog seeded in production (Phase 2d)

**5 programs · 9 cohorts · 342 activities**, seeded idempotently:

- one `LearningProgram` per challenge `Domain` (SE / DS / AI / CLAUDE) plus
  `ai-cohort-program`
- cohort slugs `legacy-se`, `legacy-ds`, `legacy-ai`, `legacy-claude`
  (`cohortSlugForDomain`) and `legacy-program-<programCohortId>` per existing
  `ProgramCohort` (`cohortSlugForProgramCohort`)
- activities carry deterministic ids derived from their legacy rows —
  `act_dt_<dailyTaskId>`, `act_pd_<programDayId>` (see `src/repositories/ids.ts`,
  mirrored in `prisma/scripts/migrate-078-shared.ts`)

These mappings are what give every legacy challenge/program enrollment and
submission a **deterministic destination** in the new architecture, which is also
what makes the backfill idempotent and re-runnable.

---

## 5. Business rules

### Challenge day calculation (IST)
- All challenge day boundaries in IST (Asia/Kolkata)
- Day 1 = day of the reference start in IST (`max(challenge.startsAt, enrollment.startedAt)` when synchronized; else `enrollment.startedAt`)
- `getCurrentDayNumber` in `lib/date-utils.ts` **caps at 60** — use for display, unlocking, streaks
- `getElapsedDayNumber` is **uncapped** (61+) — the only correct input for backfill / relaxation-window decisions. Using the capped version here is what broke day-60 submissions; do not use it for UI day labels either.
- CLAUDE enrollments roll from the real join date, floored at the cohort `startsAt`
- `BYPASS_DAY_LOCKS=true` bypasses challenge day-lock gating server-side (dev only)

### Submission validation
- GitHub URL must match `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}`, be globally unique, and return HTTP 2xx on HEAD (5s timeout)
- LinkedIn URL format-only (`/posts/…` or `/feed/update/…`) — LinkedIn blocks bots
- Both proof URLs are **optional** since Synergy; a submission with neither still counts for the day but earns fewer SP

### Synergy points (SP)
- Per submission: `10` base `+ 5` if GitHub proof `+ 8` if LinkedIn proof (`features/synergy/scoring.ts`)
- Referral: `3` SP
- `User.synergyPoints` is the denormalized balance (one wallet for challenge **and** hackathon students); `StudentProfile.synergyPoints` is a temporary rollback mirror. `SynergyEvent` is the source of truth — never move SP without writing an event row.
- Admin community synergy grant cap: **3000** (raised from 2000 on 2026-08-18)
- Admin reset / reject clamps both `User` and `StudentProfile` synergy at 0 and writes a `BALANCE_RECONCILIATION` event for already-spent submission points, so the ledger can never go negative
- While `ENABLE_DUAL_WRITE` is on, every SP movement on a wired path also writes `PointsTransaction` + `PointsAccount`. Legacy stays authoritative.

### Streaks
- `currentStreak` = consecutive ON_TIME submissions ending today/yesterday; `longestStreak` = max ever reached
- Late submissions don't count; missing a day resets to 0
- Streaks / `daysCompleted` are **write-time only** (`submitDay`) — dashboard read paths must never write

### Leaderboard (per-domain)
1. daysCompleted DESC → 2. currentStreak DESC → 3. longestStreak DESC → 4. startedAt ASC. Cached 5-min TTL via `unstable_cache`.
- Immutable content (daily tasks, `Challenge.startsAt`) cached via `unstable_cache` tags `daily-tasks:<challengeId>` / `challenge:CLAUDE`, busted on reseed/redeploy.

### Certificates
- Claude Challenge certificate issues when there is a **Day 60 submission AND `daysCompleted >= 50`** — deliberately not gated on `EnrollmentStatus.COMPLETED`
- ID format `ABT-XX-XXXXX` (CC / HK / CH / WS per type), Crockford alphabet (no 0/O/1/I/L)
- Rendered by overlaying `pdf-lib` text + QR onto a template PDF in `public/certificates/` (mtime-busted cache). `CERTIFICATE_TEMPLATE_URL` / `CERTIFICATE_TEMPLATE_PATH` optionally override with a no-store fetch.
- Public verification at `/verify/[certificateId]`, download at `/verify/[certificateId]/download`
- Hackathon: ViCoDathon 2026 participation certificates (`ABT-HK-XXXXX`), with per-type templates via `HACKATHON_CERTIFICATE_TEMPLATE_URL` / `_PATH`. Placement certs (winner / 2nd / 3rd / top5) are extra `HACKATHON` rows keyed by `metadata.hackathonVariant`, issuable on production via `--all --allow-production` on `issue-hackathon-award-certificates.ts`

### Marketplace
- Redeem spends SP inside a transaction: balance check → `Redemption` row → negative `SynergyEvent`. Refund is the mirror image (also a `SynergyEvent`).
- Catalog `costSP` currently 1800 SP across `marketplace.json`

### Quiz availability
- Only the CURRENT week's quiz is shown; `currentWeek = Math.min(Math.floor(daysCompleted / 7), 8)`
- Already-attempted → show score; not seeded → show nothing; past attempts in "Quiz History"

### Referrals
- 6-char uppercase alphanumeric code per StudentProfile; reward at referred user's Day 7
- Persisted via `abtalks_ref` httpOnly cookie (7 days, set in middleware)
- Badges: bronze (1), silver (5), gold (10), platinum (25)

### Hackathon
- Solo or team entry; team joined by `teamCode`; duplicate team names blocked case-insensitively
- Registration requires a Google session; one participant row per user globally
- Share-link attribution: `?s=<slug>` → `abtalks_src` httpOnly cookie, **first touch wins**, 30 days, copied to `HackathonParticipant.sourceSlug`
- Removal hard-deletes the participant and writes a `HackathonRemoval` row (leader or admin); rejoin re-uses the preserved `sourceSlug`
- A logged-in user with a hackathon registration but no `StudentProfile` is diverted to `/hackathon/dashboard` (not `/register`) from `/`, `/dashboard` and `/login`

### Workshop
- Page public, **form session-gated**: the event is resolved server-side from the IST day key, never from the client; email comes from the session
- `P2002` on `[eventId, userId]` → friendly duplicate message; confirmation email failure is logged and swallowed

### Program (AI Cohort) — differs from the challenge on purpose
- **Timezone: `PROGRAM_TZ`, now `Asia/Kolkata`** (changed from America/Chicago on 2026-08-12). Day unlock uses the cohort calendar with a sequential gate (no unlock-on-pass); admin `highestUnlockedDay` is a floor override. Calendar-key math stays UTC-based (`addCalendarDaysToKey`) so a timezone reformat doesn't drop day 0. Admin cohort `startsAt`/`endsAt` round-trip via `fromZonedTime(PROGRAM_TZ)` so Mission Control's cohort day matches today's mission. Never hard-code the zone — read `PROGRAM_TZ`.
- **US cohort freeze rule:** the US AI cohort (name "AI Cohort USA") stays unfrozen until every `ENROLLED`/`COMPLETED` member has passed Day 31 — `endsAt` is ignored until then. The India cohort still freezes on `endsAt`.
- 31 days total (`PROGRAM_TOTAL_DAYS`), max score 1020 = 372 mission + 93 concept + 155 commit + 400 project
- New ENROLLED members **start at Day 4**; Days 1–3 are waived as PASSED with mission points (`npm run db:bootstrap:program-start-day` backfills existing members)
- 5 server-verified mission types: CODE_SPRINT (hidden outputs), SHIP_IT (GitHub repo checks — file existence only; content/minLines/notebook checks gated off), DATA_ROOM (answers), PROMPT_FORGE (Anthropic eval cases), BOSS_BUILD (project submit). Unlimited runs, 15s spacing, 30/day cap. Pass unlocks the next day (+12 mission pts; `cleanPassCount` when passed on attempt #1).
- Skip tokens (2, after ≥3 fails) are **disabled for members** currently; concept checks and the entry assessment are **bypassed** (`isProgramEntryBypassEnabled()` returns true unconditionally) — apply enrolls or waitlists directly
- Commit tracking: daily Vercel cron polls GitHub per member repo; `commitPoints = 5 × qualifying ProgramCommitDay rows` (cap 150), preserving the existing floor via `Math.max` so seeded days aren't wiped. Commit UI is archived on Mission Control (`PROGRAM_COMMIT_UI_ENABLED = false`); backend retained.
- Behind-by / at-risk pace uses the **cohort calendar day**, not the Day-4 unlock ceiling (calendar+3) — otherwise on-time members were falsely flagged ~4 days behind
- At-risk = behind >2 days, stuck on a mission >2 IST days, or 0 commits in the last 5 days
- Exit voice interview: one 15-min OpenAI Realtime WebRTC session per member, unlocked on Day 31 progress or cohort end; server-minted ephemeral secret at `POST /api/program/interview/session`; transcript stored then Claude-evaluated (comm / tech / problem / overall + summary), scored separately from `totalScore`; max 2 member restarts; admin can reset / re-evaluate
- AI layer: admin-triggered Claude project grading (rubrics.json + GitHub context, admin override → AdminAction); member-triggered AI Mentor review (one per passed mission/day); batch recommendations with 7-day TTL; `projectPoints` recomputed idempotently via `recomputeMemberScore`
- Recruiter portal `/talent`: Google sign-in + company profile, admin approval, pool gated on `cohort.resultsPublishedAt`; ranked profiles with mission portfolio, projects, interview summary, private shortlists. **Member phone / entry details are never exposed.**
- `missionSpec` is server-only; `assetsJson` is the only client-safe day asset

### Recruiter discoverability and candidate visibility (078 — current product decision)

**Recruiter discoverability is a platform default, not a user-facing profile
toggle.** For new post-078 candidates, being searchable is the default state:
`CandidateVisibility.searchableByRecruiters` now defaults to `true`, and new
`/program` applications stamp `ProgramMember.recruiterVisibilityConsentAt`
automatically.

`CandidateVisibility` is an **internal enforcement / privacy / moderation
structure** (it carries `withdrawnAt`, `consentSource`), not a preference screen.

Three concepts that must not be collapsed into one:

| Concept | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `searchableByRecruiters` | may a recruiter *discover* this candidate at all |
| per-field privacy | which fields a recruiter may *see* — email, phone, résumé, assessment/interview detail stay separately gated. Being searchable does **not** make any of these public. Member phone / entry details are never exposed. |
| `CandidatePreference.openToWork` | is the candidate *actively job hunting* |

`searchableByRecruiters = true` with `openToWork = false` is a normal, expected
state: *"recruiters may discover this candidate, but they are not currently
looking."*

**Intended initial recruiter-searchable population:**

1. existing **AI Cohort members** (~50), plus
2. eligible candidates created/registered **after** the 078 platform-default launch.

**Explicitly NOT** all ~12,800 historical platform users. Historical users outside
the intended AI-cohort population are not opened just because the column default
changed — the default applies to *new rows*, and the Phase 1 migration did not
rewrite existing ones.

**Open migration caveat (not resolved):** the latest production Phase 2b run
processed ~12,803 users but found only **19** historical opted-in/searchable
sources (explicit `recruiterVisibilityConsentAt` timestamps, out of ~64
`ProgramMember` rows). `prisma/scripts/migrate-2b-visibility.ts` has since been
amended to treat **every `ProgramMember` as searchable by platform default** — but
that change is currently **uncommitted in the working tree** and the repository
carries no evidence it has been re-run against production. Recruiter-visibility
data must be reconciled against the *AI Cohort + post-launch candidates* rule and
verified before `ENABLE_NEW_TALENT` is ever turned on.

**Legal copy is out of step and this is a known, deferred task.** The published
Privacy/Terms copy still describes recruiter discoverability as **opt-in**.
Reconciling that copy (or the product decision) is a pending business/legal item —
it is *not* solved.

**Legacy live read path (today):** `visibleProgramMemberWhere()` in
`src/repositories/talent.ts` is the single visibility fragment, and on the legacy
path it still requires `ProgramMember.recruiterVisibilityConsentAt` to be set.

### Campus Ambassador
- Onboarding is **off-site** (abtalksca.netlify.app); the in-dashboard apply flow is stopped
- Challenge-enrolled students see a banner plus a derived bell notice

### Legal / consent
- `TERMS_VERSION` `2026-08-10`, `PRIVACY_VERSION` `2026-08-11` (client-safe constants live in `src/lib/legal-constants.ts` — importing `@/lib/legal` from a client component pulls `node:fs/promises` into the browser bundle)
- Consent is recorded at OAuth signup: `auth.ts` `events.createUser` writes TERMS+PRIVACY rows under source `oauth_signup`. `/login` carries a notice, not a checkbox
- Cookie chooser is a small bottom-right banner (all | limited | essential), stored in the `abtalks_consent` cookie with no DB row; it gates `abtalks_ref` / `abtalks_src` in middleware
- Newsletter opt-in is pre-checked on all signup funnels and excluded from the submit gate
- Bumping a version triggers the reconsent banner

### Phone OTP
- MSG91 OTP required in production; **skipped under `next dev`** (`isOtpVerificationRequired()` returns false when `NODE_ENV === "development"`)
- `OTP_DEV_BYPASS=true` + `OTP_DEV_CODE` (default `1234`) for non-dev-mode local/CI runs

### Admin actions
- Original 5 student actions: markDayComplete (`admin-marked://` URL), resetProgress, toggleReadyForInterview, removeFromChallenge (soft → ABANDONED), rejectSubmission
- Plus hackathon, program, recruiter, redemption, job, remark and link admin mutations — **all wrapped in a transaction with an `AdminAction` audit row**, surfaced in the paginated `/admin/actions` feed

---

## 6. Authentication architecture

### Two auth modes
- **Production (Vercel):** Google OAuth only. `ENABLE_DEV_AUTH` not set.
- **Local dev:** Google OAuth (if configured) AND Credentials (email + plaintext password).
- Dev credentials login always navigates **same-origin** (ignores the `AUTH_URL` host in `result.url`) so LAN/phone testing works; local `AUTH_URL` is optional when `trustHost` is on. `allowedDevOrigins` auto-includes LAN IPv4s so Next 16 serves `/_next` on the Network URL.

### Auth.js v5 split config
- `src/auth.config.ts` — minimal, edge-safe (no Prisma, no `@/lib/*`). Used by middleware.
- `src/auth.ts` — PrismaAdapter + real Credentials authorize. Used everywhere else.
- Required because Vercel middleware runs in Edge Runtime with a 1 MB bundle limit.

### Session strategy
- JWT sessions (stateless). `AUTH_SECRET` required, no fallback. `trustHost: true`.
- Cookies: `__Secure-authjs.session-token` (prod) / `authjs.session-token` (local)

### Authorization layers
- **Admin:** email-based via `ADMIN_EMAILS`; `requireAdmin()` in `lib/admin-auth.ts`; `session.user.isAdmin` computed in the JWT/session callback. No DB role for admin.
- **Program / recruiter:** `lib/program-auth.ts` (node-only) — `requireProgramMember` (resolved by membership, not by role) and `requireRecruiter` (DB-checked, `Role.RECRUITER` + admin approval)
- **Middleware:** path-prefix list only (`/dashboard`, `/explore`, `/challenge/`, `/profile`, `/achievements`, `/quiz`, `/register`, `/admin`, `/jobs`, `/mission`, `/program/*` app routes, `/talent`, `/hackathon/register`, `/hackathon/dashboard`) — redirects to `/login?from=…`. It also sets the `abtalks_ref` and `abtalks_src` tracking cookies on every request.

### Stale session warning
- JWT sessions don't verify the user still exists in the DB per request. Deleted users keep a valid cookie until expiry; FK violations are possible. Cleanup-script deletions require clearing cookies / incognito.

---

## 7. Routing structure

### Public
- `/` — the marketing landing site, rebuilt from the final static build as `src/components/landing/site/` (page-scoped `--lp-*` CSS, a shared `ScrollEngine`, contact form → team@abtalks.in). The earlier three-track `landing-hub` is retired. It renders for **signed-in users too** — no redirect to `/dashboard`; track cards show "Open dashboard" per track via `features/landing/get-landing-state.ts`. `/login` bounces signed-in users to `/`.
- `/challenges` — public 60-day challenge overview (domain picker, streak grid, FAQ)
- `/login`
- `/students/[id]` — public student profile (basic info only)
- `/claude-signup` — Claude track signup / interest page
- `/verify/[certificateId]` + `/verify/[certificateId]/download` — public certificate verification and PDF download
- `/r/[token]` + `/r/[token]/pdf` — public share link for an admin-curated recruiter assessment report
- `/ai-workshop`, `/ai-workshop/events` — workshop microsite. Page public; the **registration form requires a Google session**. Signups → Neon `WorkshopRegistration`; `workshop_config` (Zoom/WhatsApp links) still read from Supabase.
- `/ai-cohort-register` + `/apply` — AI Cohort (US) onboarding + 5-step application → Supabase `cohort_applications`
- `/ai-cohort-india` + `/apply` — India clone → Supabase `cohort_applications_india`
- `/hackathon` — hackathon landing (`/hackathon/register`, `/hackathon/dashboard`, `/hackathon/submission` are protected)
- `/program` — program landing (gated by `ENABLE_PROGRAM`; `notFound()` when unset)
- `/terms`, `/privacy`, `/privacy/requests`, `/cookies`, `/contact` — legal surface (entity + Grievance Officer blocks, DPDP rights, DSAR intake)

### Protected (student)
- `/register` — **profile-only** since 2026-08-20: no domain pick, no enrollment. "Registered" = has a `StudentProfile`; the first track joined backfills `StudentProfile.domain`. Supports STUDENT and PROFESSIONAL `userType`, plus CLAUDE-forced mode via `?domain=CLAUDE`; auto-cleans orphaned profiles
- `/dashboard` — the **student hub** (plan 066): `DashboardShell` + `getHubData`, hero greeting, activity heatmap, streak card, Continue Journey, Other Challenges, Roadmaps, Events, FAQ. Master-only production pieces that survive on top of the hub: the **campus ambassador banner**, the **hackathon promo modal**, and the hackathon/program redirect behavior for users without a profile.
  - **Migration detail:** the hub still reads **legacy** `Enrollment` / progress (via `getHubData` → `repositories/learning`, and `repositories/legacy/student-profile`). It has **not** switched to `ProgramEnrollment` / `EnrollmentProgress`.
- `/ai`, `/ds`, `/se`, `/claude` — per-track dashboards (`TRACK_PATH` in the hub)
- `/explore` — track list / cross-track discovery
- `/challenge/today` → `/challenge/[day]` — uses `dailyTask.dayContent` when present, else legacy text fields
- `/profile`, `/quiz/[quizId]`
- `/achievements` — earned certificates
- `/mission` — community / mission page (Discord link)
- `/marketplace` — redeem SP
- `/jobs`, `/jobs/[id]` — jobs board + apply

### Protected (hackathon)
- `/hackathon/register`, `/hackathon/dashboard`

### Protected (program — all behind `ENABLE_PROGRAM`)
- `/program/apply`, `/program/assessment`
- `/program/dashboard` (Mission Control), `/program/day/[day]`, `/program/curriculum`, `/program/videos`, `/program/leaderboard`, `/program/interview`

### Recruiter desk
- `/hire` — Scout. **Public**: the conversation and a search run for guests; auth is a dialog at checkout, not a wall at the door. `/hire/matches` is public too.
- `/hire/requests`, `/hire/[requestId]`, `/hire/evidence` — behind a session.
- `/talent/shortlist` (the cart), `/talent/members/[id]` (evidence profile), `/talent/login`, `/talent/register`, `/talent/pending` — retained.
- `/talent` — **the pool browser was removed.** It listed the same candidates the search already ranks, and `getTalentPool` was the query still selecting `fullName`. The path is now a permanent redirect to `/hire`; middleware stops gating it so the redirect can fire.

### Admin (`/admin`, requires admin email)
- `/admin` — overview, live submissions feed, recent admin actions
- `/admin/students`, `/admin/students/[id]` (tabs + StudentActionPanel + remarks). Lists challenge **and** hackathon students via a track filter (`ALL | CHALLENGE | HACKATHON`)
- `/admin/submissions` (with a Hackathon sub-tab for the `HackathonSubmission` feed + CSV), `/admin/content`, `/admin/analytics`
- `/admin/actions` — paginated audit-log feed
- `/admin/notifications` — notification composer
- `/admin/data-requests` — DSAR queue
- `/admin/campus-ambassadors`, `/admin/referrals`, `/admin/redemptions`
- `/admin/jobs`, `/admin/jobs/[id]`
- `/admin/workshop` — per-event rosters (Registrations / Analytics tabs, `?events=` filter), CSV export
- `/admin/hackathon`, `/admin/hackathon/students`, `/admin/hackathon-links`
- `/admin/ai-cohort` — Supabase cohort applications (US + India)
- `/admin/program`, `/admin/program/members`, `/admin/program/members/[id]`, `/admin/program/content`, `/admin/program/projects`, `/admin/program/interviews`, `/admin/program/recruiters`

### API routes (sparse — most logic via Server Actions)
- `/api/auth/[...nextauth]` — Auth.js handler
- `/api/claude-recent-signups` — public ticker data
- `/api/cron/program-commits` — Vercel cron, Bearer-auth via `CRON_SECRET`
- `/api/program/interview/session` — mints an OpenAI Realtime ephemeral secret
- `/api/chat` — site help chatbot (behind `ENABLE_CHATBOT`)
- `/api/cron/hire-alerts` — Vercel cron; notifies recruiters whose `alertWhenAvailable` brief now has matches
- `/api/cron/078-drift` — 078 legacy-vs-new drift probe (also runnable as `npm run db:check:078:drift`)

---

## 8. Server Actions (`src/app/actions/`)

**Challenge core:** `auth-actions`, `registration-actions`, `enrollment-actions`, `submission-actions`, `profile-actions`, `quiz-actions`, `referral-actions`, `otp-actions`, `synergy-actions`

**Student features:** `marketplace-actions`, `job-actions`

**Hackathon:** `hackathon-actions`, `hackathon-auth-actions`, `hackathon-team-actions`

**Workshop / cohort funnel:** `workshop-actions`, `cohort-application-actions`, `cohort-application-india-actions`

**Program:** `program-entry-actions`, `program-mission-actions`, `program-ai-actions`, `program-interview-actions`, `talent-actions`

**Recruiter (challenge side):** `recruiter-review-actions`

**Hire desk:** `hire-actions`, `hire-guest-actions`, `hire-request-actions`, `recruiter-auth-actions`, `recruiter-seat-actions`

**Admin:** `admin-actions`, `admin-export-actions`, `admin-remark-actions`, `admin-redemption-actions`, `admin-job-actions`, `admin-recruiter-actions`, `admin-hackathon-actions`, `admin-hackathon-link-actions`, `admin-program-actions`, `admin-program-export-actions`, `campus-ambassador-actions`

All return the discriminated union `{ ok: true, data } | { ok: false, message }`.

---

## 9. Feature modules (`src/features/`)

`registration/` · `enrollment/` · `submission/` · `challenge/` · `dashboard/` · `profile/` · `quiz/` · `user/` · `synergy/` · `certificate/` · `marketplace/` · `jobs/` · `recruiter/` · `hackathon/` · `workshop/` · `program/` · `hire/` · `talent-pool/` · `email/` · `admin/`

Notes:
- `program/` is the largest module (missions, verify-mission, days, progression, commits, mentor, recommendations, projects, interview, leaderboard, entry, admin, bootstrap-start-day, parse-brief, constants)
- `certificate/` owns ID generation, eligibility/issue, PDF render, template source, achievements
- `workshop/` has admin data, analytics, prefill, recent registrations, registration status. `getWorkshopConfig` is **not** here — it stays in `lib/workshop-supabase.ts`.
- `recruiter/` holds the `@react-pdf/renderer` document (`recruiter-pdf.tsx`) — keep it out of client/edge bundles
- `hire/` is the Scout agent and the matching pipeline: `scout-graph` / `scout-tools` / `scout-agent` (LangGraph), `track-registry` + `track-loaders` (which pools exist and how to read them), `dossier` / `challenge-dossier` / `hackathon-dossier`, `score-candidate`, `pool-brief`, `sample-card`. It is **server-only** — a test asserts no client module imports the agent, its tools or the graph.

### Repository layer (`src/repositories/`) — the 078 migration boundary

This is a **major architectural boundary**, added in 078 Phase 3. It is what makes
Phase 6 possible: the read implementation can be swapped without rewriting UI.

```
UI / Server Actions  →  repositories  →  legacy tables   (today)
                                      →  new 078 tables  (Phase 6, flag-gated)
```

| File | Concern |
|---|---|
| `candidate.ts` | `getCandidateProfile`, `getProfileSummary` |
| `learning.ts` | `listChallengeEnrollments`, `findActiveMembership`, slug helpers |
| `progress.ts` | `getDashboardPrograms` — the enrolled-program cards |
| `talent.ts` | `searchCandidates`, `visibleProgramMemberWhere` (the **only** visibility fragment) |
| `points.ts` | `getBalance` |
| `credentials.ts` | `getByPublicId`, `listForUser` |
| `types.ts` | the return-type contract both implementations must satisfy |
| `ids.ts` | deterministic legacy→new id derivation, mirrored in the migration scripts |
| `dual-write.ts` | Phase 4 new-side writes, each wrapped in a `SAVEPOINT` |
| `drift.ts` | legacy-vs-new drift counters |
| `legacy/student-profile.ts`, `legacy/program-member.ts` | legacy adapters — features never call `prisma.studentProfile` / `prisma.programMember` directly |

Rules:

- Each repository function branches on its `ENABLE_NEW_*` flag. **All flags are
  off**, so every branch currently resolves to the legacy read.
- **Return types are the contract.** Both implementations must return the same
  shape, or Phase 6 becomes a UI rewrite.
- **New application code must not add direct dependencies on retiring models** —
  `StudentProfile`, `ProgramMember`, or legacy recruiter-specific candidate
  identity structures — wherever a repository function can be used instead.
- Legacy reads stay behind the repository / `legacy/` adapters for the duration of
  the migration. Do not "clean them up".

---

## 10. Content management

- Challenge content: `prisma/content/problems.json`, `prisma/content/quizzes.json`, seeded via `npm run db:seed`
- Upserts on (challengeId, dayNumber) / (challengeId, weekNumber); quiz questions clean-replaced each reseed
- Program content seeded separately (`npm run db:seed:program`) — reseed after any mission-spec change
- Marketplace catalog from `marketplace.json` (`npm run db:seed:marketplace`)
- Days/weeks not in JSON render as "Day X placeholder"
- NO admin UI for challenge content editing (program content has a read view at `/admin/program/content`)

---

## 11. Seed scripts

```
npm run db:seed                    # challenge content + 10 test users (@abtalks.dev)
npm run db:seed:content            # content only
npm run db:seed:test-users         # test logins only
npm run db:seed:claude-test        # CLAUDE test users (incl. one deterministic 60/60 completed login)
npm run db:seed:program            # program cohort content / missions
npm run db:seed:program:users      # prog.*@abtalks.dev / "test" + test cohort, members, recruiters
npm run db:seed:marketplace        # marketplace catalog
npm run db:seed:hackathon-links    # named share links
npm run db:bootstrap:program-start-day   # waive Days 1–3 for existing ENROLLED/COMPLETED members
npm run db:backfill:certificates   # issue certs for already-eligible enrollments
```

Base test users (password `test`): Arjun (SE D1), Priya (DS D1), Rohan (AI D1), Sneha (SE D7 + quiz), Vikram (DS D15), Anika (SE D30), Karan (AI D45 broken streak), Meera (SE D60 COMPLETED + ready), Dhruv (SE D20 + 3 referrals), `admin@abtalks.dev` (ADMIN, password `admin`).

`SEED_ALLOW_PRODUCTION` guards seeds against a production database.

---

## 12. Cleanup & migration scripts

- `npm run db:cleanup:test | :real | :all` — delete test users / real Google users / everything (5s pause; cascades handle related rows)
- `npm run hackathon:preflight | hackathon:migrate | hackathon:verify` — the Supabase → Neon hackathon cutover (`scripts/migrate-hackathon-to-neon.ts`). Already executed; kept for reference.
- `scripts/merge-problems.mjs`, `scripts/seed-swarit-recruiter-profile.ts`

### Plan 078 migration scripts (`prisma/scripts/`)

```
npm run db:seed:platform-taxonomy         # ProgramCategory / Skill taxonomy
npm run db:migrate:078:phase2             # full Phase 2 backfill (2a..2i), idempotent
npm run db:migrate:078:phase2:sample      # PHASE2_SAMPLE=1 — representative user slice
npm run db:migrate:078:phase2:production  # PHASE2_ALLOW_PRODUCTION=1
npm run db:check:078:drift[:sample|:production]
npm run db:check:078:dual-write[:rehearsal]
npm run db:check:078:phase5               # points, visibility count+leak, statuses, shadow
npm run db:078:preflight:production       # orphan preflight + Phase 1 DDL applier
npx tsx prisma/scripts/migrate-078-verify.ts   # V1..V10 verification pack
```

Step scripts: `migrate-2a-identity` · `2b-visibility` · `2c-roles` ·
`2d-learning-content` · `2e-enrollments-attempts` · `2f-points` ·
`2g-credentials` · `2h-recruiting` · `2i-achievements`, over the shared
helpers in `migrate-078-shared.ts` / `migrate-078-bulk.ts`.

Every step is **idempotent and restartable** — it writes `MigrationRun` /
`MigrationConflict` / `MigrationQuarantine` rows and checkpoints its cursor, so a
crashed run resumes rather than re-doing work.

**Migration performance rule (learned the hard way).** The first full rehearsal on
`plan-078-rehearsal` ran **~4.5 hours** and died in 2f, because the high-volume
steps did one Prisma upsert — one network round-trip — per row. Observed volumes:
~10.9k users, ~10.9k education rows, ~15.4k attempts, ~14.8k points transactions,
~12.8k `PointsAccount` rows. The scripts were redesigned to use:

- `createMany` where the write is insert-only
- batched `INSERT … ON CONFLICT` / bulk upsert where the step must be re-runnable
- configurable bounded batches (`PHASE2_BATCH_SIZE`, default and current
  production value **100**)
- progress logging, retry (P1001), resume/checkpoint behavior

The production historical backfill is deliberately **batch-oriented and online** —
the site stays up while it runs.

## 13. Environment variables

### Core
- `DATABASE_URL` — Neon pooled connection
- `DIRECT_URL` — Neon direct connection (migrations; added to fix deploy lock timeouts)
- `AUTH_SECRET` — random hex, no fallback
- `AUTH_URL` / `NEXTAUTH_URL` — site URL (optional locally when `trustHost` is on)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` — same as AUTH_URL
- `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`
- `ADMIN_EMAILS` — comma-separated admin emails

### Feature flags
- `ENABLE_DEV_AUTH` — Credentials provider, localhost only
- `ENABLE_CLAUDE_CHALLENGE` — Claude track visibility
- `ENABLE_PROGRAM` — gates all `/program` and `/talent` routes (`notFound()` when unset)
- `HIRE_OPEN_COHORT_IDS` — cohorts `/hire` may match before results are published; comma-separated ids or `all`. Unset = published cohorts only.
- `HIRE_CHALLENGE_POOL` — whether `/hire` also searches the 60-day challenge track, and from how many verified days (`=10`, or `=true` for the default floor of 10). Unset = off.
- `GROQ_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY_2`, `GROQ_API_KEY_3` — Scout's model calls; `askGroqJson` falls through to the next key on 429/401. `HIRE_GROQ_MODEL` overrides the model.
- `ENABLE_CHATBOT` — site help chatbot (`/api/chat` + `ChatWidget` in the root layout)
- `BYPASS_DAY_LOCKS` — bypass challenge/program day gating server-side (dev)
- `OTP_DEV_BYPASS`, `OTP_DEV_CODE` — skip MSG91, accept a fixed code (default `1234`)
- `SEED_ALLOW_PRODUCTION` — required to run seeds against prod

### Plan 078 migration flags (`lib/feature-flags.ts`)

**Current production state as of this reconcile:**

| Flag | Production | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `ENABLE_DUAL_WRITE` | **ON** | supported writes go to legacy **and** new 078 tables |
| `ENABLE_NEW_CANDIDATE` | **off / unset** | candidate reads stay legacy |
| `ENABLE_NEW_LEARNING` | **off / unset** | learning reads stay legacy |
| `ENABLE_NEW_PROGRESS` | **off / unset** | progress reads stay legacy |
| `ENABLE_NEW_TALENT` | **off / unset** | recruiter/talent reads stay legacy |
| `ENABLE_NEW_POINTS` | **off / unset** | balance reads stay `User.synergyPoints` |
| `ENABLE_NEW_CREDENTIAL` | **off / unset** | credential reads stay legacy |

Therefore, today: **READ → legacy. SUPPORTED WRITES → legacy + new 078. Legacy
remains authoritative.** Phase 6 has **not** started. Do not flip an
`ENABLE_NEW_*` flag on row counts alone — the Phase 5 verification gate comes first.

`DIRECT_URL` must be set to the same Neon database on a **non-pooler** host
whenever `ENABLE_DUAL_WRITE=true`.

### Operator-shell variables (never set these in Vercel)

- `PHASE2_ALLOW_PRODUCTION=1` — allow a Phase 2 step to touch production
- `PHASE2_BATCH_SIZE` — backfill batch size (default and current production value `100`)
- `PHASE2_SAMPLE=1` — run against a representative user slice instead of everything
- `PHASE2_RESET_CHECKPOINT=1` — ignore crash cursors and restart a step
- `CONFIRM_PRODUCTION_DDL=078-phase1` — required to apply Phase 1 DDL
- `PRODUCTION_NEON_HOST_ID` — host guard so a script cannot run against the wrong branch

### Integrations
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (+ optional `PROGRAM_ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, default `claude-sonnet-5`) — server-only Claude JSON grading via `lib/anthropic.ts`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — Realtime `client_secrets` minting for the exit voice interview (server-only)
- `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` — GitHub REST for SHIP_IT verification + the commit cron
- `CRON_SECRET` — Bearer auth on `/api/cron/program-commits`
- `RESEND_API_KEY`, `BREVO_API_KEY`, `FROM_EMAIL`, `FROM_NAME` — transactional email
- `MSG91_AUTH_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_MSG91_WIDGET_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_MSG91_TOKEN_AUTH` — phone OTP
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — `workshop_config` + cohort applications
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — server-only; was required for the Supabase hackathon tables (now retired)
- `CERTIFICATE_TEMPLATE_URL` / `CERTIFICATE_TEMPLATE_PATH` — optional overrides for the certificate template
- `HACKATHON_CERTIFICATE_TEMPLATE_URL` / `_PATH` — per-type hackathon certificate templates
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` — optional generation backend for the help chatbot

## 14. Conventions

### Code style
- TypeScript strict, no `any`
- Server Components by default; `"use client"` only when needed
- Server Actions for mutations (preferred over API routes)
- Zod validation at every boundary
- Prisma queries always use `select`; multi-step writes in transactions
- Errors via `lib/logger.ts`, never `console.error`
- Result envelope `{ ok: true, data } | { ok: false, message }` everywhere

### Routing
- Auth routes are public (no `requireRole`)
- Everything else uses `requireRole([...])` / `requireAdmin()` / `requireProgramMember()` / `requireRecruiter()`
- Logout is idempotent (fail-closed silent)

### Files
- `src/features/<domain>/` — business logic
- `src/lib/` — shared utilities (db, auth, logger, validations, date-utils, feature-flags)
- `src/app/actions/` — Server Actions
- `src/components/ui/` — shadcn primitives (don't modify)
- `src/components/<feature>/` — feature components

### Changelog discipline
Cursor appends ONE dated line to `docs/CHANGELOG.md` under `## Pending reconcile` after any schema change, new/changed business rule, new env var, or new convention — never for cosmetic changes or bug fixes. Those lines are folded into **this** document during a reconcile pass. Cursor never edits `CLAUDE.md` or `docs/project-context.md`.

---

## 15. Design system

### Typography
- Display: Plus Jakarta Sans (`font-display`) for headings; Body: Inter
- `dseg7-classic` for seven-segment countdown displays

### Current design language
New UI follows **`docs/design-system.md`** (plan 071 — orange / cream). The
modernist and pre-modernist templates are **retired as templates**; existing
screens were not restyled. `/program/dashboard` and `/program/day` were rebuilt on
the cream/orange system (`/program` app shell is light, Curriculum nav hidden but
the route kept). The student hub (`/dashboard`) carries its own Jakarta/Fredoka
tokens.

### Colors (CSS vars in `globals.css`) — legacy screens
- Light: warm off-white background, pure white cards. Dark: deep blue-gray.
- Primary: indigo `239 84% 67%` (#4F46E5)
- Domain colors — AI violet `#8B5CF6`, DS cyan `#0891B2`, SE emerald `#10B981`

### UX patterns
- Cards: `rounded-xl`, soft border, subtle shadow, `hover:shadow-md`
- Buttons: NEVER `<Button asChild>` or `<Button render={<Link>}>` — use `buttonVariants` directly on the `<Link>` (Base UI is strict about button semantics)
- Theme toggle: single sun/moon button, system default; optional click sound (off by default)
- Mobile-first (390px tested)
- Program day pages use a distinct **Figma dark shell** with a `briefMd` section parser — deliberately not the challenge theme

---

## 16. Known issues / decisions parked

### Resolved (don't touch)
- Edge Runtime middleware must avoid `@/lib/*` imports → split `auth.config.ts`
- Auth.js v5 default cookie name change → `auth()` middleware pattern
- Stale Prisma client after `node_modules` delete → `npx prisma generate`
- Postgres enum rename ML → DS via `ALTER TYPE RENAME VALUE`
- FK violation when User deleted but session still valid → clear cookies
- `<Button render={<Link>}>` Base UI nativeButton warning → `buttonVariants`
- Deploy lock timeouts on migrate → added `DIRECT_URL`
- Day 60 not submittable → use uncapped `getElapsedDayNumber` for backfill/relaxation
- Chicago reformat dropping commit day 0 → UTC calendar-key math
- Dead login form over LAN IP → `allowedDevOrigins` includes LAN IPv4s
- Neon pooled endpoint dropping Prisma interactive transactions with `SAVEPOINT` → dual-write and migrations use the **direct** (non-pooler) host via `writeClient()`
- 078 Phase 2 migrations timing out at ~4.5h → batched `INSERT … ON CONFLICT` + `createMany` + bounded batches, not per-row upserts

### Open issues blocking the 078 migration
- **Phase 2e is stopped on a `P2032`.** Prisma reports `ProgramMember.jobRole` expected a non-null `String` but the database contains `null`; one of 64 `ProgramMember` rows has `jobRole IS NULL`. `prisma/schema.prisma` **already declares `jobRole String?`**, so the diagnosis is a **stale / mismatched generated Prisma client**, not bad data. The production row is legitimate — do **not** "fix" it by writing an empty string. The fix is to regenerate/use the correct client (`npx prisma generate`) and resume the idempotent migration.
- **Recruiter-visible population is not yet correct.** See §5 — the 2b fix exists in the working tree but is uncommitted and unverified against production.
- **Legal copy still says recruiter discoverability is opt-in**, while the product decision made it a platform default. Deferred business/legal task.
- Production still carries a leftover migration folder `20260813000000_general_interview` (from the reverted PR #168 AI-cohort interview foundation). Because of it, `prisma migrate deploy` cannot be used on production — 078 migrations are applied with `prisma db execute` + `prisma migrate resolve --applied`. Do not apply or drop that schema.

### Cleanup candidates spotted during this reconcile
- `src/lib/hackathon-supabase.ts` has **no importers** — dead since the Neon cutover; the same is true of `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`'s only documented purpose
- `StudentProfile.phoneVerified*` + `PhoneVerification` were noted as "unused" when MSG91 was removed on 2026-07-21, then OTP was restored on 2026-07-27 — they are live again, but the OTP surface is skipped in dev
- `ProgramEntryQuestion` / `ProgramEntryAttempt` and the skip-token machinery remain in the schema while bypassed in product

### Deferred / not built
- **External candidate-platform abstraction** — LeetCode / CodeChef / Codeforces / Kaggle and similar. No model exists. Expected to be **additive** later.
- **Opportunity-type preferences** — internship / full-time / freelance / contract / part-time. `CandidatePreference` today has `openToWork`, `availableFrom`, preferred roles/locations and remote preference only. Also additive later. `openToWork` stays **independent** of recruiter discoverability.
- Resume **upload** (binary, Vercel Blob) — only the URL field exists
- Admin UI for challenge content CRUD
- Plagiarism detection beyond global URL uniqueness
- Rate limiting on auth/submission endpoints
- Email verification (Google handles OAuth users)
- Heatmap cells clickable to view a past day's problem
- Logo scroll animation (ABTalks → AB collapse)

### Security TODOs
- No rate limiting on auth or submission endpoints
- No email verification for any flow
- No password policy beyond min 8 chars
- No CSRF tokens beyond Next.js defaults
- No content security policy headers
- No automated session invalidation on user deletion

## 17. Working with Cursor — guardrails

### Before any DB-touching change
1. `git add -A && git commit -m "checkpoint before X"`
2. Create a Neon branch as a snapshot
3. Note the commit hash

**All Neon mutations must target a production child branch** unless that exact
production write is explicitly authorized. During 078, migration and dual-write
work must use the **direct (non-pooler)** endpoint — see §3.

### Cursor failure modes observed
- Adds `requireRole` to public routes (logout, login) — mark exceptions explicitly
- Confuses Server vs Client boundaries when passing props (Lucide icons, functions)
- Defends wrong choices when build errors contradict its model (jose subpath import)
- Over-engineers (new files for trivial logic)
- Misses transitive imports causing Edge bundle violations
- Sometimes silently fails to apply file changes

### Working pattern
Small scoped prompts → explicit "do NOT" lists → Cursor reports back → you verify → manually test → commit per task. On breakage, gather data (logs, file contents, exact error) before fixing.

- **078 additive schema in production** (47 tables + 3 audit tables) and **live dual-write** on supported paths
- Production deployment on Vercel

### Migration in progress — Plan 078 (NOT complete)
- Historical **Phase 2 backfill is incomplete**; it is currently **stopped in 2e** on a Prisma generated-client mismatch (`P2032`, see §16)
- **Phase 6 reads are not enabled** — every `ENABLE_NEW_*` flag is off
- Legacy tables remain populated and **authoritative for every read**

### Plan 078 phase status

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| **Phase 1** — additive schema | **PRODUCTION APPLIED.** All 47 expected 078 tables present (`CandidateProfile`, `CandidateVisibility`, `ProgramEnrollment`, `ActivityAttempt`, `PointsAccount`, `PointsTransaction`, …) plus `MigrationRun` / `MigrationConflict` / `MigrationQuarantine`. Both Prisma migrations recorded as applied, along with the additive `searchableByRecruiters` default change. |
| **Phase 2** — historical backfill | **IN PROGRESS on production. Incomplete.** See the step table below. |
| **Phase 3** — repository layer | **Implemented** (`src/repositories/`, §9). |
| **Phase 4** — dual-write | **Implemented, tested and live** on supported production write paths. |
| **Phase 5** — verification | **NOT COMPLETE.** Backfill reconciliation and the zero-drift gate are still pending. |
| **Phase 6** — switch reads | **NOT STARTED.** All `ENABLE_NEW_*` remain off. |
| **Phase 7** — stop writing legacy | **NOT STARTED.** |
| **Phase 8** — drop legacy schema | **NOT STARTED.** |

### Phase 2 production backfill — step status

Batch size **100**, online (no downtime), idempotent and restartable.

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| **2a** identity | 10,913 `CandidateProfile` records processed · 10,983 education · 617 experience · **376 identity conflicts** · 0 quarantine · 0 batch errors |
| **2b** visibility | ~12,803 users processed; the run reported only **19** historical opted-in/searchable sources. **Needs reconciliation** against the *AI Cohort + post-launch candidates* rule before `ENABLE_NEW_TALENT` (§5). |
| **2c** roles | 10,913 candidate role sources · 1 admin |
| **2d** learning catalog | 5 programs · 9 cohorts · 342 activities (idempotent) |
| **2e** enrollments & attempts | Challenge `ProgramEnrollment` migration **completed 3,183 / 3,183** — then **STOPPED**. `ProgramMember` → `ProgramEnrollment`, `Submission` → `ActivityAttempt`/`ActivityEvaluation`, and `ProgramMissionSubmission` → `ActivityAttempt`/`ActivityEvaluation` are all **incomplete**. |
| **2f–2i** points, credentials, recruiting, achievements | **Not reached.** |

The blocker is the `P2032` described in §16 — a stale generated Prisma client, not
a corrupt production row. The migration resumes from its checkpoint once the
client is regenerated.

### Dual-write — validated and live

`ENABLE_DUAL_WRITE=true` in production. Legacy write is authoritative; the new-side
write runs inside a `SAVEPOINT` so a new-table failure logs and is rolled back
without failing the user's request.

Wired dual-write paths:

- challenge enrollment (`create-core-enrollment`, `create-claude-enrollment`)
- program membership (`features/program/entry.ts` — apply / enroll)
- challenge submission (`submit-day`)
- Program mission verification (`features/program/missions.ts`)
- points award / spend / refund (submission award, referral award, marketplace
  redeem, admin redemption refund, admin points actions)

**Live organic production probes succeeded.** A real user enrolling in Claude, SE
and AI produced the corresponding new `ProgramEnrollment` rows; an SE Day 1
submission produced the legacy `Submission` + progress **and** a new
`ActivityAttempt` + `ActivityEvaluation`; points produced the legacy
`User.synergyPoints` / `SynergyEvent` behavior **and** new `PointsAccount` +
`PointsTransaction`. The dashboard continued showing **legacy** progress and did
not jump to the new data — which is the intended behavior while `ENABLE_NEW_*` is off.

### Agreed rollout strategy (conservative)

```
additive schema
  → dual-write, legacy authoritative
  → online restartable historical backfill (site stays up)
  → final catch-up / delta reconciliation
  → zero-drift verification (V1–V10, points, visibility count + leak, shadow reads)
  → gradually enable ENABLE_NEW_* reads
        (credentials → points → progress + learning → candidate → talent LAST)
  → after stable new reads: Phase 7, stop writing legacy
  → observation period
  → Phase 8, remove legacy schema (one table at a time)
```

The historical bulk backfill must **not** require the site to be offline. A short
write freeze / maintenance window may be used only for the final delta and
reconciliation.

### Recruiter product direction

There is **no meaningful recruiter user population** that needs legacy
recruiter-account compatibility, which is what made it safe to replace the
recruiter surface outright rather than migrate it.

**The recruiter experience is now built, as `/hire`.** What it is:

- **Scout** — a LangGraph agent (`StateGraph` + `ToolNode` + `ChatGroq`,
  `openai/gpt-oss-120b`, `reasoning_effort: medium`) over a track registry. The
  model *proposes*; the engine validates and acts, so a tool call can never widen
  the pool by itself. Eight tools — `list_tracks`, `get_pool_stats`,
  `update_brief`, `set_pool_filters`, `preview_matches`, `reset_brief`,
  `offer_options`, `search_pool` — each returning `{applied, rejected}`.
  Protected attributes are refused at a hard gate before the model is reached.
- **The desk** — a two-view surface (Scout / Shortlist), a candidate inspector,
  an evidence resume, and Save-for-later as a device-local list that is
  deliberately *not* the Shortlist. Nothing on Save-for-later has been shown to
  the team; moving a candidate to the Shortlist is the act that puts them in
  front of anyone.
- **Engagements** — see `TalentEngagementRequest` above. Contact release is per
  recruiter/candidate pair and derived from status.
- **Empty searches** return sample cards built from the recruiter's own spec.
  `SAMPLE:` refs stay off the track whitelist, so a sample can never be
  shortlisted or introduced.

**Honest architectural note.** `/hire` does **not** query the normalized 078
tables. It reads `ProgramMember` (and the challenge / hackathon equivalents)
through per-track dossier loaders in `features/hire/track-loaders.ts`, because
`ENABLE_NEW_TALENT` is still off and the 078 candidate/evidence data is not the
live source. The track registry is the seam: when the 078 reads switch on, the
loaders change and the agent, tools and UI do not. Treat this as deliberate
sequencing, not as the end state — candidate discovery should still end up on
normalized evidence data.

**`ENABLE_NEW_TALENT` remains OFF.** The candidate pool, once the
`CandidateVisibility` backfill is corrected and verified, is the AI Cohort
candidates plus eligible post-launch new candidates — widened per track by
`HIRE_OPEN_COHORT_IDS` and `HIRE_CHALLENGE_POOL`.

### Not yet built
- Full real Day 1–60 content for SE / DS / AI (placeholders remain where JSON is missing)
- Resume upload (binary)
- External coding-profile models (LeetCode / CodeChef / Codeforces / Kaggle) and opportunity-type preferences — both additive, later

### Next priorities
1. Fix the Prisma generated-client mismatch causing the Phase 2e `P2032`.
2. Resume and complete Phase 2e — historical `ProgramMember`, `Submission` and `ProgramMissionSubmission` migration.
3. Continue the optimized 2f points backfill and the remaining Phase 2 steps.
4. Correct and verify the recruiter-visible population: **AI Cohort + post-launch candidates only** — not all ~12,800 historical users. Commit and re-run the amended 2b.
5. Run the full Phase 5 reconciliation: drift, points, visibility count + leak, shadow reads.
6. Begin controlled Phase 6 repository read switches **only after** that verification passes.
7. Move `/hire`'s track loaders onto the 078 candidate/evidence reads once Phase 6 is verified.
8. Resume Databricks / interview-agent product work once the migration foundation is stable.

## 19. How to use this document in new chats

Paste this entire document at the start of a new chat with:

> "I'm working on a project called ABTalks. Read this context document carefully before we start. After reading, just say 'Context loaded' and ask me what I want to work on."

---

## 20. Document maintenance

Update this document when:
- A major feature ships
- A core decision changes (tech stack, business rule, scope)
- Schema changes
- New env vars added
- New conventions adopted

Don't update for tiny bug fixes, cosmetic changes, or routine commits.

**Reconcile pass:** read `docs/CHANGELOG.md` → `## Pending reconcile`, fold every line into the right section here, then clear that list and note the reconciled-through date at the top of this file. The doc should reflect architecture and decisions, not every line of code.

Two things to check each pass:
- **Entries can end up outside the heading.** Merges have pushed Cursor's lines above `## Pending reconcile`. Read the whole file, not just the section.
- **Verify claims against the code.** The changelog is a claim, not proof — the 2026-08-24 pass found `PROGRAM_TZ` had moved to `Asia/Kolkata` while both this document and `CLAUDE.md` still asserted America/Chicago.

**While Plan 078 is in flight:** never describe the new model as serving reads, never describe legacy tables as retired, and always state which phase each claim belongs to (see §18).
