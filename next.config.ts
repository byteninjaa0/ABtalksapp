/**
 * T-259. The Sentry build plugin does one thing that matters: it uploads source
 * maps, so a production stack trace reads as `contact-access.ts:41` instead of
 * `main-8f3a.js:1:24817`. Without that, an error tracker tells you an error
 * happened and not where.
 *
 * It is inert without `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` / `SENTRY_ORG` / `SENTRY_PROJECT`,
 * which is the state of every local build and every environment until those are
 * set in Vercel — the build succeeds either way, it just uploads nothing.
 *
 * `deleteSourcemapsAfterUpload` matters: the maps are uploaded to Sentry, then
 * removed from the deployed output. Leaving them served publicly would publish
 * the application's source, which is a bigger disclosure than anything else
 * T-259 guards against.
