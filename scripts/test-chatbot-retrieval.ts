/**
 * Chatbot retrieval regression suite.
 *
 *   npm run test:chatbot-retrieval                  # semantic, using recorded query vectors
 *   npm run test:chatbot-retrieval -- --record      # refresh query vectors (needs OPENAI_API_KEY)
 *   npm run test:chatbot-retrieval -- --lexical-only # BM25 only, explicitly
 *
 * WHAT THIS TESTS
 *
 * The real thing. It reads the real `knowledge/` corpus with the production
 * chunker, builds the production lexical index, loads the real
 * `knowledge/embeddings.json`, and calls `rankAndGate` — the same function the
 * route calls. Nothing here reimplements retrieval or the confidence gate, so a
 * pass describes production behaviour rather than a parallel system.
 *
 * WHY IT RUNS OUTSIDE NEXT
 *
 * Retrieval is split so that the parts that decide what comes back
 * (`chunking`, `lexical`, `engine`) are pure and importable from plain Node,
 * while the parts that reach the filesystem and OpenAI (`corpus`,
 * `embeddings`) keep their `server-only` fence. This suite imports the pure
 * side. `server-only` was NOT removed from any production file to make this
 * work.
 *
 * WHAT IT NEVER DOES
 *
 * No Gemini, no Groq, no Anthropic, no generation of any kind. It stops at the
 * gate — which is the layer whose correctness actually decides whether the
 * product invents things.
 *
 * QUERY VECTORS
 *
 * Chunk vectors come from the committed artifact. Query vectors cannot: an
 * embedding of the test question has to come from OpenAI at some point. Rather
 * than fake one (a mock vector would make every semantic assertion
 * meaningless), the suite RECORDS real query embeddings once into
 * `knowledge/test-query-vectors.json` and replays them. That keeps runs
 * offline, deterministic and free, while every number in the semantic path is
 * a genuine `text-embedding-3-small` output.
 *
 * If a query has no recorded vector and no key is available, the run FAILS with
 * an explanation. It never silently downgrades to lexical — a green suite must
 * not be able to mean "semantic never ran".
