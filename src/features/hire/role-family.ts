/**
 * A usable role bucket from a free-text job title.
 *
 * `ProgramMember.jobRole` is whatever the member typed at application time.
 * The live cohort contains "Student", "student", "STUDENT", "Fresher",
 * "B.Tech 3rd year Student", "Software (Data) Engineer", "Data Analyst-
 * Benefits" and "Credit Risk Analyst Intern" — so the raw string is unusable
 * for grouping, filtering or a salary band, and showing it back to a recruiter
 * as a job title overstates what it is.
 *
 * The raw label is still kept on the dossier and shown as "self-described as
 * …". This function only produces the bucket used for aggregates and for the
 * indicative compensation band.
 *
 * No `import "server-only"` — the card renders the label.
