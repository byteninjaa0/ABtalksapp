/**
 * One conversational turn.
 *
 * This file used to be 1,500 lines and decided everything with regexes that ran
 * BEFORE the model saw the message: `extractPoolBrief` could commit a filter and
 * fire a search, so "who is prime minister of india" matched an India pattern and
 * searched the pool 94 lines before the question detector was reached. Scout's
 * understanding was exactly its keyword list.
 *
 * What is left is two things the agent should not be asked to do:
 *
 *   1. The CHIP PROTOCOL. A tapped chip carries an exact machine value
 *      (`skip:salary`, `salary:500000-1000000`, `edit:mustHaveStack`,
 *      `action:search`). An exact match is proof of a tap, so it is parsed here
 *      with no model call — instant, free, correct with Groq unreachable, and on
 *      an 8000-TPM plan the reason a conversation of taps costs nothing.
 *
 *   2. TURN ASSEMBLY. `spec`, `summary`, `readyToSearch` and the chips are
 *      computed from the brief. The agent supplies prose and tool calls; it never
 *      decides what the requirement says or whether a search is possible.
 *
 * Everything else — reading the message, asking the next question, answering
 * about the pool, choosing to search — is the agent's, through validated tools.
 */

/**
 * Merge the recruiter's answer into ONE named slot.
 *
 * Deliberately slot-scoped. The previous implementation guessed which field a
 * free-text reply belonged to, so the answer to "what role?" was filed as a
 * required skill and the real stack answer was then discarded. Answering a
 * question can no longer write to a field that question didn't ask about.
 *
 * This runs before the model does and does not depend on it, so a chip click
 * lands correctly even when the AI is unreachable.
