/**
 * What Scout can actually filter on — and what it must admit it cannot.
 *
 * A recruiter asked for "profiles who are in US" and Scout replied "Noted — US
 * location it is." No candidate on the platform has ever shared a location, so
 * that was a promise the search could never keep, and the recruiter had no way
 * to know. Accepting an unsupported filter is worse than refusing it: the
 * shortlist that comes back looks like an answer to the question that was
 * asked.
 *
 * Every gap here is a fact about the data, not a limitation of the model, so
 * this list is the honest one and it lives in exactly one place.
 *
 * Shared, not server-only — the chat renders these strings. `hireChallengePool`
 * only reads `process.env`, which is inlined at build time for anything the
 * client bundles.
