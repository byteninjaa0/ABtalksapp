 * Which cohorts `/hire` may search, and why each one qualifies.

 * This exists because the gate was one line inside `searchCandidates` —
 * `resultsPublishedAt != null` on a single `findFirst` — and it made the whole
 * product unreachable: no cohort on the platform has ever had results
 * published, so the search returned an empty array before it read a single
 * member row.
 *
 * Two deliberate differences from `/talent`:
 *
 * 1. **Every open cohort, not the latest one.** `findFirst` meant a second
 *    running cohort was invisible no matter how good its people were.
 * 2. **A cohort can be opened mid-flight** (see `hireOpenCohortIds`), because
 *    evidence-so-far is real evidence. `/talent` keeps its published-only gate
 *    untouched — see `assertPoolAccess` in features/talent-pool/pool.ts.
 *
 * Consent is *not* configurable here and never will be. It is enforced in
 * `memberEligibilityWhere` on every query, with no override, no admin bypass
 * and no demo exception.
