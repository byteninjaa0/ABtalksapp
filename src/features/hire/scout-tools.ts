/**
 * The only ways Scout can act.
 *
 * Every tool validates its own arguments and hands back what it REJECTED along
 * with what it applied. That return shape is the point: a refusal becomes data
 * the model has to account for on the next hop, instead of a prompt rule it can
 * forget. "Tell the recruiter what you could not do" stops being a hope.
 *
 * Two guarantees live here rather than in the prompt, because a prompt is not a
 * guarantee:
 *   - money is computed by `parseMoney` from the recruiter's own words, never by
 *     the model (`salaryText` is a string, never a number);
 *   - a pool filter needs the recruiter's words to corroborate it
 *     (`confirmPoolBrief`), so neither the model alone nor a stray keyword alone
 *     can move the brief.
 *
 * State lives in a per-turn context rather than a graph channel. The graph is
 * rebuilt every turn with no checkpointer, so a closure is simpler, cannot leak
 * between requests, and — the reason that matters — lets the whole tool surface
 * be tested with no graph, no model and no database.
 *
 * `server-only` stays on, and the evals still reach these executors: they run
 * under `node --conditions=react-server`, which resolves that package to an
 * empty module the way an RSC build does. Testability did not have to cost the
 * guarantee — an accidental client import would put `@langchain/core` in the
 * browser bundle, so keep the marker.
