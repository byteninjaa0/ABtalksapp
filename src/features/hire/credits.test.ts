/**
 * T-228 — the credit foundation.
 *
 * Two kinds of check live here, and both earn their place.
 *
 * The **pure** ones cover the rules that are arithmetic or policy: what $20,000
 * is in minor units, what a missing price resolves to, what an idempotency key
 * looks like. They need no database and they never flake.
 *
 * The **source assertions** cover a class of rule a unit test structurally
 * cannot see. "The ledger is the source of truth" is not a function's return
 * value; it is a statement about which file reads which table, and the way it
 * gets broken is somebody, six months from now, reasonably deciding that
 * reading `CreditAccount.balance` is faster. A test that reads the source is
 * the only thing standing between that edit and a silent regression back to the
 * bare counter T-148 §2 prohibits.
 *
 * The guarantees that are genuinely the database's — the unique index, the row
 * lock, `WHERE balance + amount >= 0` — are proved against Postgres by
 * `npm run db:check:credit-ledger -- --prove`. Asserting them here against a
 * mock would prove only that the mock agrees with whoever wrote it.
 *
 * Run: npm run test:credits
