/**
 * The money half of a contact unlock (T-229, T-230).
 *
 * Separated from `unlock-contact.ts` deliberately. That file resolves *who is
 * asking* — it reaches for the session, and through it the whole auth stack.
 * This file assumes that question is already answered and does the part that
 * must be right: charge once, write the ledger, grant access, all or nothing.
 *
 * The split buys two things. The transaction can be exercised against a real
 * database without a script having to fake a session — which matters, because
 * the guarantees T-230 is about are row locks and unique indexes, and a mock
 * cannot honestly stand in for either. And the session boundary stays one
 * short, readable function instead of being buried in the middle of a money
 * path.
 *
 * **The ids here must never come from a request.** `unlockContact` is the only
 * caller and it derives every one of them from the session. A server action
 * reaching past it into this file would be handing the browser its own
 * `organizationId`.
