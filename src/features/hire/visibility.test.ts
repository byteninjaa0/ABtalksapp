/**
 * The recruiter-discovery gate — run with:
 *   npm run test:visibility
 *
 * No network, no database. Two kinds of check:
 *
 *  1. The gate itself has the shape it claims to have.
 *  2. Every query in `/hire` that loads candidate rows actually applies it.
 *
 * (2) is a source scan, which is unusual for a unit test and deliberate. The
 * failure this guards against is not a wrong boolean, it is a *missing clause*:
 * before this change the program path was gated and the challenge and hackathon
 * paths were not, so a challenge participant who had never been made searchable
 * could be shortlisted and, at CONTACT_SHARED, have their details released. A
 * shape assertion cannot catch that. A fifth track added next quarter without
 * the gate is the same bug, and this is what fails when someone writes it.
