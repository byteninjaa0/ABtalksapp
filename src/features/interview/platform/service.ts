 *     client input and is never trusted beyond being a lookup key
 *   - plan and state are reloaded from the row on every turn
 *   - duration is computed from the persisted `startedAt`
 *   - an answer must match the question the SERVER believes is open — enforced
 *     inside the graph's `receiveAnswer` node
