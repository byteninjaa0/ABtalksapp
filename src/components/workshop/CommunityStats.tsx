              2519×746 and sits 300px outside its 1919×146 box on every side:
              that overhang IS the blur, so it must not be squashed to the box.
              Recoloured from the Figma blue to the palette's #03535F and held
              at ~1/3 opacity — orange is far denser than the pale blue was, and
              at full strength it reads as a solid band rather than a wash.

              Shortened from 746 to 470 and dropped from -289 to -150. Two
              things wrong with the original: it reached 457 of an 818 frame, so
              it was still colouring the section past the statistics; and its
              glow peaked at 84, close enough to the top that `overflow: hidden`
              cut it near full strength and drew a hard line along the seam with
              the section above. Peaking at 85 with a longer tail above the clip
              keeps the top edge soft, and the wash is spent by 320 — the top
              40% — which is where the overlay below takes it to white. */}

              lays white over just this canvas.

              It now reaches solid white by 46% and HOLDS it to the bottom edge,
              which it could not do while the events section below was a solid
              --wk-bg-alt peach — white against that was a step. That section is
              --wk-bg now, two shades off white, so the seam is invisible and the
              lower half of this one can be properly clean.
