/**
 * Runtime platform configuration (T-148 D-17, T-228).
 *
 * Everything tunable in this codebase has so far lived in `process.env` —
 * `feature-flags.ts`, `match-config.ts`, `pool-policy.ts`. That is the right
 * home for a switch that turns a route on, and the wrong home for a number the
 * business changes: an env var moves only when somebody deploys, and "we would
 * like recruiters to start with $100 instead of $200" should not be a release.
 * So these numbers are rows, and this file is the only way to read them.
 *
 * ## Why a registry rather than free-form keys
 *
 * The registry below is the single declaration of what a key is called, what
 * kind it is, what it may range over and what it means when the row is absent.
 * `PlatformConfigKey` is a union of those names, so a typo is a compile error
 * rather than a setting that silently does not exist — and a setting that does
 * not exist is a setting that does not apply. This is the same argument
 * `entitlements.ts` makes for `PlanLimitKey`.
 *
 * ## Why the fallback is the default and never zero
 *
 * A missing row, a null column and an out-of-range value are all the same kind
 * of event: the database could not tell us what this number is. The tempting
 * answer, `0`, is the one answer that must never be given for a price — a
 * configuration outage would silently make paid contact unlocks free, which is
 * a revenue failure and, because unlocking releases a candidate's contact
 * details, a privacy one too. So an unreadable value resolves to the registry
 * default and says so in the log.
 *
 * `server-only`: this decides what things cost, and a Client Component that
 * could import it is a price the browser is being asked to quote itself.
