/**
 * The deterministic fast path, running BEFORE retrieval.
 *
 * THE RULE FOR ADDING ANYTHING HERE:
 *
 *   An intent may return a constant only if the answer is a route, an email
 *   address, or a UI affordance — something that cannot go stale. Anything
 *   about dates, eligibility, pricing, tags, rules or program details belongs
 *   in `knowledge/` and must go through retrieval.
 *
 * This rule is not academic. Two intents used to live here that broke it, and
 * both silently served wrong answers for months, because a match here means
 * the knowledge base is never consulted:
 *
 *   - a Claude Challenge intent listing tags "@abtalksonai, #abtalks,
 *     #60DaysOfClaude, #60DaysOfGenAI". The live challenge page and the
 *     official guidelines PDF both say to tag Anthropic, Anil Bajpai and
 *     ABTalksOnAI. Retrieval had the right answer; this overrode it.
 *   - an "is ABTalks free" intent answering "completely free" after the site
 *     had moved to "most challenges are free; paid cohorts are priced up
 *     front".
 *
 * Both are deleted. Do not reintroduce factual answers here, and do not grow
 * this file into a keyword FAQ — that is what the retrieval pipeline is for.
