/**
 * Workshop events — the canonical read boundary. Plan 163.
 *
 * Replaces the hardcoded `EVENTS` array. Two rules live here and nowhere else,
 * so no page can invent its own:
 *
 * 1. **Public eligibility.** A row reaches the public site only when it is
 *    published and not archived. `listPublicEvents` is the only public read;
 *    everything user-facing goes through it. The ten ported events are all
 *    archived, so the public schedule is empty until an admin publishes
 *    something — and `placeholderSaturdays()` fills the calendar with TBA in
 *    the meantime.
 * 2. **Rows become the shape the helpers already speak.** `toWorkshopEvent`
 *    maps a row to the existing `WorkshopEvent` interface, so the calendar,
 *    timeline and registration logic keep their current code and only change
 *    where their data comes from.
 *
 * The icon travels as a NAME and is resolved with `iconFor` at the point of
 * render. Resolving it here would put a React component in Server->Client
 * props, which cannot be serialized - the constraint EventsCalendar's own
 * docblock used to satisfy by reading the module array directly.
